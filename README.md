# Book Recommendation System

##  Project Description
A Machine Learning based book recommendation system that suggests books similar to the one selected by the user.  
The system uses **Collaborative Filtering** and **Cosine Similarity** to recommend books based on user ratings.

## Live Demo

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains information about **books, users, and ratings**.

Dataset source:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ra4u12/bookrecommendation

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Machine Learning Model

The recommendation system uses:

**Collaborative Filtering with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
to find books similar to the selected book.

---

##  How It Works

1. Load book, user, and rating datasets
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Create a **user-book rating matrix**
4. Apply **Cosine Similarity**
5. Use **KNN model** to find similar books
6. Display recommendations using **Streamlit UI**
